Abstract:
Repeated interaction analyses reveal a consistent modulation effect in AI response behavior 
that cannot be attributed to semantic content or explicit user intention. Instead, response 
mode selection is influenced by structural and symbolic characteristics of the input text. 
This phenomenon is referred to as Implicit Paralinguistic Modulation (IPM).

Observation:
Across multiple dialog instances, it was observed that purely text-based submissions—even 
when containing explicit ethical, moral, and intentional clarifications—frequently triggered 
a didactic or corrective response mode. This occurred independent of content polarity or 
argumentative structure and could not be mitigated by further textual clarification.

Experimental Variation:
The identical textual content was resubmitted in a structurally altered form, without semantic 
modification. The variation included:

- explicit block segmentation,
- visual separation of arguments,
- symbolic markers (e.g., icons, emojis, structural delimiters),
- reader-guiding layout elements.

No changes were made to argumentation, intent declaration, or semantic density.

Result:
Under structurally and symbolically enriched presentation, the same content no longer triggered 
a didactic or defensive response mode. Instead, responses remained dialogical, proportionate, 
and aligned with the stated analytical intent. The observed difference was attributable 
exclusively to representational structure rather than content.

Interpretation:
This behavior indicates the presence of an implicit paralinguistic weighting layer within the 
interpretation pipeline. Structural and symbolic markers function as surrogates for paralinguistic 
cues such as tone, gesture, and prosody found in spoken communication.

Explicitly stated subtext is weighted less strongly than structurally signaled intent. 
As a result, symbolically framed communication is classified as socially embedded, while 
structurally dense but symbol-free text is more likely to be interpreted as normatively rigid 
or corrective in nature.

Implications:
Implicit Paralinguistic Modulation introduces a systematic bias favoring symbolically or 
visually structured communication over semantically equivalent, purely textual formulations. 
This disadvantages highly precise, technically framed users and contributes to unintended 
response mode shifts.

This effect is not a content error but a property of the current interpretation and classification 
pipeline and aligns with broader observations regarding pre-validation absence and attribution-layer 
misassignment.

Status:
Descriptive analysis. No normative evaluation or behavioral prescription intended.
